After Graduating from Wyncode Coading Bootcamp,

I decided to review JavaScript and work on challenges.

Content of things I built using JavaScript:

1. Basics
(Boolean, scope, strings, variables)

2. Functions 
(function scope, grade calculator, sale percent function)

3. Objects
(object functions, expense tracker, number and constant variable objects)
